You beat the two men and attempt to catch your breath, but you suddenly hear a flight of footsteps charge towards you.

"GIVE US YOUR NEURALINK*TM* NOW!!" they shout. It's the NeuraThieves*TM*!
They send their CHEEF THEEF your way and he looks ready to brawl..

They say they need your Neuralink*TM* to mine crypto, and that if you don't comply...

... He'll rip it right out of your head.

Portland just keeps getting worse and worse! But you won't give up your Neuralink*TM* that easy.
You ready yourself for battle
