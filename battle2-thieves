You beat the two men and attempt to catch your breath, but you suddenly hear a flight of footsteps charge towards you.

"GIVE US YOUR NEURALINK*TM* NOW!!" they shout. It's the NeuraThieves*TM*!
They charge towards you, saying they need your Neuralink*TM* to mine crypto, and that if you don't comply...

... they'll rip it right out of your head.

Portland just keeps getting worse and worse! But you won't give up your Neuralink*TM* that easy.
