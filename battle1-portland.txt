While you walk around the most harrowing, revolting, sickening, loathsome city in the world, Portland... Eugh...
You suddenly trip and fall face first to the ground, and notice shadows looming over your body.
You look up to see two men standing over you, and they look to be contaminated with Pythonic Parasites.
They repeatedly mutter the words "ELON MUSK" over and over again.
You hastily get up and stand your guard.
