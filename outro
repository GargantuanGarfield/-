You finally defeat Syed, clearing the citizens of Portland from the Pythonic Parasites.
A spot of light shines above you, and the spirit of NetworkChuck floats down towards you.
He stands in front of you and thanks you for freeing him from Python Syed.
NetworkChuck was cursed to stay in Portland forever, but he's finally been freed.

You walk alongside each other and into the sunset, exiting Portland once and for all.

...

You hear your alarm blaring. You open your eyes and wake up in your bed.
You go to turn off your alarm, and notice your phone buzzing from a phone call.
You go to answer the phone and say,

"Hello, this is Andrew Glassner speaking."
