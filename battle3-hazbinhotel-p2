You excitedly sigh of relief due to finally being somewhere better than Portland.
But you weren't the only one to have walked through the doorway to Hazbin Hotel.
As you look behind you... you notice the infamous PORTLAND STOOGES!!!
The notorious three stooges, 'Stoxxie', 'Abdelalastor', and 'Abram Morningstar' approach you.
They threaten to drag you out from Hazbin Hotel,

and back to... Portland.

You refuse to go back to the horrors of Portland, and you won't go back without a fight.
