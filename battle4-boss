You defeat the Portland Stooges, but unfortunately were thrown out of Hazbin Hotel and back into Portland.
You scream out of anger, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"
It's your ultimate mission to get out of Portland once and for all and you make a run for it.
You start to see the city limits of Portland, but before you can cross, you feel the ground shake beneath you.
The ground shatters as a *giant* Python erupts from beneath the ground.
The sheer size leads you to believe that must be the leader behind the epidemic of Pythonic Parasites.
But as you take a closer look seeing it slither towards you, you enter a state of shock as you recognize who it is.
"Wait... That's Syed!"
The only obstacle standing between you and getting out of Portland is Syed.
And you'll do whatever it takes to get out of Portland.
